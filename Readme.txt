Assignment 2 (Iris Recognition System)

Develop a Compressed Sensing based Iris Recognition system.

The program was written in python and is available in an .ipynb format.

The following libraries were used :

import cv2
import sys
import glob
import numpy as np
import cvxpy as cp
import scipy
import scipy.signal
import math

To run the program first put the location of the image file(CASIA dataset) so that images can be loaded
After that put the location of the query image.

Run the .ipynb code and get the class of the image.
